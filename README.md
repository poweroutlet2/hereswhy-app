# Threads
Threads is a web app that displays twitter threads. ThiThe thread data available to the app is dependent on what the threads-injestor
picks up. The injestor currently runs every hour, so no updates are made until then. 

This app was made using the T3 stack (including TRPC, Typescript, Tailwind, NextJS, Prisma, Zod)
